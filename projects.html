    <p>The following items below describe the various projects, videos/images of the projects, and different explanations pertaining to the projects that I developed either with a partner or alone while taking the Computer Science Principles Course.</p>
    <h2>My Scratch Project</h2>
    <video src="images/MHA Story Mode Intro_Trim.mp4" width="600" controls>
</video>
    <p>My scratch program is a story mode game. My partner and I wrote this game in Scratch using command prompts to write the code. The purpose of my game is to have the user play a short story game where they can choose from multiple super powers and different choices to experience different dialogue options and endings. The video shows the tutorial section of the game, in which you get to put your name, choose a gender, and pick a quirk (a super power). The video also illustrates the choice mechanic of the game and the text display. It also explains the situation of the game and continues with the first choice option.</p>
    <p>While writing the code for this program, my partner and I encountered a few difficulties. One of the first collaborative difficulties was setting up the code to have multiple choices. At first, we thought of having a sprite below the screen to say something which would cover up the dialogue box with the text. We decided not to have that since the placements of the options would be awkward and would display a dialogue box within a dialogue box. We decided on having different costumes for the dialogue box, each with the dialogue and the dialogue options. Whenever the dialogue box was on a certain costume, it would wait for an arrow key input, and from there it would display the different dialogue boxes according to which key you chose and/or depending on what super power you have. An independent difficulty that I experienced when writing the code was timing a specific costume to display when a sprite finished saying something. At first, I thought I tried timing up the two different scripts according to how long the timing was, which was difficult. Then I decided that it would just be best to broadcast a message at the end of one of the scripts. Then, the script would receive its own broadcast, and the other script would also receive the script at the same time.</p>

    <p>This program is a video/playlist finder app to find videos of animals. My partner and I wrote this app in MIT App Inventor using command prompts to write the code. The purpose of the app is to have the user select from different animals and be able to find videos based on that animal. The video shows the basic run-down of the app where the user is given a selection of animals from dogs, cats, horses, birds, and bunnies. The video also shows the app opening the browser with a playlist of the animal selected. </p>
    <p>While writing the code for this program, my partner and I encountered quite a few problems. The initial idea that we wanted the program to do was to allow the user to select from different words that would then be added to a search queue. The words would then be used to generate a video randomly using YouTube. We decided not to go with this idea, however, due to the unpredictability in the results that may generate with the search queue. We then decided that we can give the user a selection of topics which ended up being animals. The user was to be able to tap on an animal which would open another screen. On that screen would be a video player with a stop and play button on the bottom. The plan for the video player was to include the files of the videos in the app itself, where the app would then randomly generate a number, add it to a text list (i.e catVid(#).mp4), and play the video. The video was unable to play for reasons unknown to us at the time, so we then tried to play the YouTube video on the app itself. We tried using the web viewer to play the video, but the video box resulted in a black screen As a last resort, we decided to remove the different screens for each animal completely and use the main screen with the buttons to play the videos. In the end, the app uses the activity starter to take the user to a web browser with a corresponding playlist to the chosen animal. The most difficult part of creating the app was trying to find a solution to the video player issue.</p>
    
    <h2>Interactive Fiction Project</h2>
     <video src="images/Interactive Fiction.mp4" width="600" height= "400" controls>

    </video>
    <p>This program is an interactive fictional story where the user can choose their own path in a story. The programming language used to create the program was Python 2.7.2. The purpose of the app is to have the user interact with a fictional story with the teacher, Mr. Engstrom, being the main protagonist. The user would receive descriptions on what was happening in the story and would be given a choice between two paths to interact with the story and experience different outcomes. The video above shows a user interacting with the program by typing a letter, representing the choice they chose, which would then give a description of what happened with their choice in the story.

      <p>This project program is a short game called ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock’ where the user can play against a computer in Rock, Paper, Scissors with more options. The programming language used to create the program was Python 2.7.2. The purpose of the program is to have the user select from the choices of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock and play against a computer. The program randomly selects one from the list to play against you, which then checks for different conditions to see whether the player wins or loses. The video above shows a user interacting with the program. It starts off by asking for a choice from the user of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The user then chooses multiple options throughout the video, each followed by the computer choice and a result of whether or not they won. Around the middle, the user begins to randomly type letters, after which the program asks for the user to choose from the list only.

      <p>This project is an investigative assignment in which my partner and I investigated which state has the highest death rate, which profession has the highest death rate, and the average life expectancy between genders. In the images above, the data that we collected has been converted to show the various distributions within the data populations in graphs and a pie chart. My partner and I collected the various data using these sites:

    <p> In this project, my partner and I were assigned to modify a simulation within the netlogo program to increase its realism. We chose the Wolf-Sheep predation simulation as we believed that it could be made more realistic by adding a new factor into the environmental simulation of water. We did this by mimicking existing code in the simulation and creating new options on the menu to allow the user to adjust the simulation for themselves depending on which parameters they would like to test.</p>
    
    <h2>Malware/Cyber Security Research</h2>
    <image src="images/ping of death.png" width="600" height= "400" controls></image>
    <p>In this project, I was assigned to research a specific type of cyber attack known as the "Ping of Death", in which a user would send a packet too large for a computer to interpret. This failure would often cause the system to restart or crash. The image shown is a slide from the presentation that briefly explains how the attack is carried out.</p>
    
    <h2>AP Create Performance Task</h2>
    <video src="images/Explore Task.mp4" width "300" height= "400" controls></video>
    <p>In this project, I developed an app using MIT App Inventor that would allow the
user to create multiple alarms/timers within one single block of time. The video
illustrates the user selecting the total amount of time they would want to set in
the time intervals, selecting how many time intervals they would like to use, and
allotting different amounts of times into the two separate time intervals.</p>
    
    <p>I created this program using an iterative development process, in which I would
write the code and test as I developed it. I first created a checklist of what a user
would most likely want in the app and began coding in order of what the user
needs to do. My main focuses were creating a menu to choose the amount of time
the users want to use, how many time intervals they want to use and how long
they want each interval to be. I immediately encountered a difficulty with the
display of the time in the main menu. I wanted the display of the time to read in
hours and minutes, however I had trouble with time changes affecting the display
correctly. After multiple attempts of creating code, I finally correctly created code
that would adjust two separate variables, one for hours and one for minutes, once
certain conditions were met. Another difficulty I had was when I was developing
the timer and its display. While testing, the display would make random changes
during each tick. To fix this, I adjusted the display code portion to interpret only
one number and convert that into hours, minutes, and seconds.</p> 

    <h2>AP Explore Performance Task</h2>
    <image src="images/Computational Innovation Artifact.png" width="400" height="700" controls></image>
    <p> In this project, I researched the service Amazon Alexa used in the various
Amazon products such as the Amazon Echo. The service is used in the products by using
speech recognition to follow voice commands given after the phrase “Hey Alexa…” which
then accesses online services to fulfill the commands handsfree to the user. The artifact shown above explains the innovation’s purpose and effect by explaining how the service is used and
effects of it.</p>
