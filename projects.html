    <p>My program is a story mode game. My partner and I wrote this game in Scratch using command prompts to write the code. The purpose of my game is to have the user play a short story game where they can choose from multiple super powers and different choices to experience different dialogue options and endings. The video shows the tutorial section of the game, in which you get to put your name, choose a gender, and pick a quirk (a super power). The video also illustrates the choice mechanic of the game and the text display. It also explains the situation of the game and continues with the first choice option.</p>
    <p>While writing the code for this program, my partner and I encountered a few difficulties. One of the first collaborative difficulties was setting up the code to have multiple choices. At first, we thought of having a sprite below the screen to say something which would cover up the dialogue box with the text. We decided not to have that since the placements of the options would be awkward and would display a dialogue box within a dialogue box. We decided on having different costumes for the dialogue box, each with the dialogue and the dialogue options. Whenever the dialogue box was on a certain costume, it would wait for an arrow key input, and from there it would display the different dialogue boxes according to which key you chose and/or depending on what super power you have. An independent difficulty that I experienced when writing the code was timing a specific costume to display when a sprite finished saying something. At first, I thought I tried timing up the two different scripts according to how long the timing was, which was difficult. Then I decided that it would just be best to broadcast a message at the end of one of the scripts. Then, the script would receive its own broadcast, and the other script would also receive the script at the same time.</p>

    <p>My program is a video/playlist finder app to find videos of animals. My partner and I wrote this app in MIT App Inventor using command prompts to write the code. The purpose of the app is to have the user select from different animals and be able to find videos based on that animal. The video shows the basic run-down of the app where the user is given a selection of animals from dogs, cats, horses, birds, and bunnies. The video also shows the app opening the browser with a playlist of the animal selected. </p>
    <p>While writing the code for this program, my partner and I encountered quite a few problems. The initial idea that we wanted the program to do was to allow the user to select from different words that would then be added to a search queue. The words would then be used to generate a video randomly using YouTube. We decided not to go with this idea, however, due to the unpredictability in the results that may generate with the search queue. We then decided that we can give the user a selection of topics which ended up being animals. The user was to be able to tap on an animal which would open another screen. On that screen would be a video player with a stop and play button on the bottom. The plan for the video player was to include the files of the videos in the app itself, where the app would then randomly generate a number, add it to a text list (i.e catVid(#).mp4), and play the video. The video was unable to play for reasons unknown to us at the time, so we then tried to play the YouTube video on the app itself. We tried using the web viewer to play the video, but the video box resulted in a black screen As a last resort, we decided to remove the different screens for each animal completely and use the main screen with the buttons to play the videos. In the end, the app uses the activity starter to take the user to a web browser with a corresponding playlist to the chosen animal. The most difficult part of creating the app was trying to find a solution to the video player issue.</p>

    <p>My program is an interactive fictional story where the user can choose their own path in a story. The programming language used to create the program was Python 2.7.2. The purpose of the app is to have the user interact with a fictional story with the teacher, Mr. Engstrom, being the main protagonist. The user would receive descriptions on what was happening in the story and would be given a choice between two paths to interact with the story and experience different outcomes. The video above shows a user interacting with the program by typing a letter, representing the choice they chose, which would then give a description of what happened with their choice in the story.

  <p>My program is a short game called ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock’ where the user can play against a computer in Rock, Paper, Scissors with more options. The programming language used to create the program was Python 2.7.2. The purpose of the program is to have the user select from the choices of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock and play against a computer. The program randomly selects one from the list to play against you, which then checks for different conditions to see whether the player wins or loses. The video above shows a user interacting with the program. It starts off by asking for a choice from the user of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The user then chooses multiple options throughout the video, each followed by the computer choice and a result of whether or not they won. Around the middle, the user begins to randomly type letters, after which the program asks for the user to choose from the list only.</p>
