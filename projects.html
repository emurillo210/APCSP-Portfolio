    <p>My program is a story mode game. My partner and I wrote this game in Scratch using command prompts to write the code. The purpose of my game is to have the user play a short story game where they can choose from multiple super powers and different choices to experience different dialogue options and endings. The video shows the tutorial section of the game, in which you get to put your name, choose a gender, and pick a quirk (a super power). The video also illustrates the choice mechanic of the game and the text display. It also explains the situation of the game and continues with the first choice option.</p>
    <p>While writing the code for this program, my partner and I encountered a few difficulties. One of the first collaborative difficulties was setting up the code to have multiple choices. At first, we thought of having a sprite below the screen to say something which would cover up the dialogue box with the text. We decided not to have that since the placements of the options would be awkward and would display a dialogue box within a dialogue box. We decided on having different costumes for the dialogue box, each with the dialogue and the dialogue options. Whenever the dialogue box was on a certain costume, it would wait for an arrow key input, and from there it would display the different dialogue boxes according to which key you chose and/or depending on what super power you have. An independent difficulty that I experienced when writing the code was timing a specific costume to display when a sprite finished saying something. At first, I thought I tried timing up the two different scripts according to how long the timing was, which was difficult. Then I decided that it would just be best to broadcast a message at the end of one of the scripts. Then, the script would receive its own broadcast, and the other script would also receive the script at the same time.</p>
